CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_books_search ON books USING gin(
  (setweight(to_tsvector('english', title), 'A') ||
   setweight(to_tsvector('english', author), 'B') ||
   setweight(to_tsvector('english', description), 'C'))
);

CREATE INDEX idx_books_genre ON books(genre);
CREATE INDEX idx_books_featured ON books(is_featured) WHERE is_featured = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_books_public ON books(is_public) WHERE is_public = true;
```

#### **3. CDN & Performance**
```nginx
# nginx.conf for production
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name readora.com www.readora.com;
    
    # Gzip compression
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/javascript application/json;
    
    # Static file caching
    location /static/ {
        expires 1y;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
    
    # API proxy
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
